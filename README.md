This is a "header only" C++ library aimed at solving numerical problems.
It allows writing programs which can be compiled without modifications on CPU and CUDA.
The library contains the following components:

1. General purpose library;
2. Single variable symbolic differentiation library (symdiff1);
3. Multiple variables symbolic differentiation library (symdiff);
4. Unstructured grid library (ugrid);
5. Functional programming library (funcprog);
6. Functional programming with CUDA support library (funcprog2);
